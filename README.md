# wapmailer

WAP client for POP3, created in 2002, published for historical reasons only.

## Notes

This is most probably my first open source email project. A simple POP3 client for WAP, written in PHP4. I don't remember too well anymore which parts did I write myself and which ones I "borrowed" from somewhere else. According to the hader I assume that `get_mime_type` function was found originally from php.net.
