# wapmailer

WAP client for POP3, created in 2002, published for historical reasons only.

## Notes

This is most probably my first open source email project. A POP3 client for WAP, written in PHP4. I don't remember anymore which parts did I write myself and which ones I "borrowed" from somewhere else.
